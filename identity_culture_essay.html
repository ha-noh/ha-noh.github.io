<h2 class="negative"> Identity and Its Basis In The Cultural Appropriation of Music </h3>
<p>
  As a phenomenon cultural appropriation is where one culture uses another's traditions while detaching the practices from their cultural context and history. Such appropriation is often motivated by a pursuit of aesthetics,  as suggested by the recent commercialization of religious items such as Buddhist beads and Christian rosaries, and the commodification of Indian bindis and Native American headdresses. Cultural appropriation is a fairly new term, and is generally the preamble to a monologue on social injustice: cultural appropriation is a symptom of asymmetrical power relations between dominant and minority cultures; cultural appropriation is the invaluable cultural information lost when popular culture whimsically adorns foreign traditions. Asymmetrical exchanges of culture only become easier with the ubiquity of computers and internet connections - transmission of information between cultures has become simple. These same politics have been discussed and debated in the past over music as well. To illustrate with musical analogs, cultural appropriation is as common a practice as digital sampling and as publicized a talking-point as hip-hop. The intention of this paper, then, is to objectively approach the intersection of cultural appropriation and music to wholesomely question its repercussions and implications. How does cultural context, and omission thereof, affect the identities of the cultures borrowing as well as the cultures being borrowed from? What information is lost when the music loses its original cultural context, and – conversely – what new identities are formed when the original context is disregarded? I will argue that cultural appropriation in music has a duality – it can obscure the music’s original identity by discarding its inherent cultural value but it can also facilitate new identities by deliberately transforming the music into new forms other cultures can use.
</p>
<h3 class="underline">Bridging Times and Spaces</h3>
<p>
  Today’s technology and popular culture facilitate the creation of new cultural amalgamates that fail to transmit the identities of their individual components. Burgeoning scenes of derivative music, such as remixes and sample based music, have created their musical signatures at the cost of the cultural context of their source material. While this is not to say that cultural appropriation is a requisite for derivative music, the internet – and the software available through it – has certainly made finding and transforming music easy. An example of this form of appropriation is described in David Hesmondhalgh’s article “Digital Sampling and Cultural Inequality”: Madonna’s song ‘Sanctuary’ features a sample of Herbie Hancock’s ‘Watermelon Man’, which in turn was an imitation of a recording of a BaBanzélé man’s musical celebration upon the return from a hunt (55). Subsequently, the average listener to ‘Sanctuary’ is unlikely to know of the foreign origins of its sound because of the convoluted chain of reinterpretations that led to its creation. This distance between the identity of Madonna’s song and the original melody that it borrows from demonstrates the duality of cultural appropriation. This sort of disparity is readily enabled by the existence of today’s digital audio workstations and web ripping software. Hesmondhalgh, the Director of Media Industries Research Centre at the University of Leed, supports this, saying
<blockquote>
  “Digital sampling proliferates such acts of borrowing by making them much easier, in that musicians can transfer musical sounds from one recording to another through a few basic programming commands… performances by non-white and non-western musicians can be incorporated directly into music made by white, western musicians, without ever having any verbal, face-to-face contact with the musicians performing the sampled extract” (56).
</blockquote>
  The more liberal sampling becomes, the more chances there are for the omission of cultural information – and now this can be done with minimal negotiation with the original artist. Internet access to an indefinitely large supply of samples allows today’s producers to follow Sanctuary’s model. The authors of “Ethic Reconfigured”, a paper that examines media consumers’ perspectives on appropriation, claim that cultural digestion and assimilation now “take place in plain sight where we can experiment with cultural permutation phenomenologically and collectively via technological interface” (Sinnreich, Latonero, & Gluck 1246). Sinnreich, Latonero, and Gluck argue that this sort of cultural appropriation is a product of how humans process new concepts - we come to understanding other cultures by breaking them down into more familiar, digestible forms. Reinterpreting music in this manner grants control over its accessibility to its audience, and we can repeatedly create new music that is more and more accessible, but at some point the original piece would be nothing more than a memory.

  By decontextualizing cultural tokens and making them easier to process, cultural appropriation facilitates the circulation of foreign media and allows cultures to identify with simplified versions of these tokens. Contrary to the BaBanzélé man’s song, some tokens persist in cultures, not because they are transformed past the point of recognition, but because they are packaged in the familiar. “Cosmopolitanism, Remediation, And The Ghost World Of Bollywood”, by David Novak, details several accounts of how the Bollywood song Jaan Pehechaan Ho was adopted by American media. In the 2001 American indie film Ghost World the song’s eclectic Bollywood scene is shown on a TV in a quiet middle class suburb with no cultural exposition – the scene tries to convey a sense of foreign mystique that is contingent on the audience, both on and off screen, not being familiar with Bollywood. “What stands out is not cultural difference but the way forms detach from cultural context, often producing an absurd effect that distances the viewer from the original stage of media production”, argues Novak, who holds a PhD in Ethnomusicology (48). Foreign music does not hold a strong presence in American media, and the ‘Gangnam Style’s are few and far between; one means of circulating foreign music, then, is by forgoing its foreign context as Ghost World did. This enables the audience to focus on the purpose of the token’s use and not its cultural origins. In the same vein, the 2001 ballet Gong is set to a score heavily inspired by Balinese music but makes a point out of being a classical ballet. In the words of Alessandra Lopez Y. Royo in “The Prince of Pagoda, Gong and Tabuh-tabuhan”, “There is no mimicking of Balinese dance in Gong, if there is any influence this is definitely transformed and it forms a continuum with the classical ballet idiom of the dancers” (56). The lack of cultural connection between the western, classical ballet choreography and the eastern Balinese music constitutes appropriation, but this enables the ballet to subsist on a western audience. Perhaps if the choreography were based on Balinese dancing, the ballet would have been lampooned as a failure of a ballet; as it is Gong can focus on succeeding as a ballet while circulating Balinese styles of music.

  If it is the case that cultural appropriation always facilitates a new identity of some sort, it might seem appropriate to argue the irrelevance of cultural appropriation. Further, the negatives of cultural appropriation are questioned when one considers that cultural appropriation is not universally accepted or experienced the same way. Alessandra Lopez Y. Royo, who is also a Research Associate of the Centre for Media and Film Studies at SOAS University of London, makes the following claim:
<blockquote>
  “Culturally, the negativity of appropriation and the notion of intellectual property are an Euro-American, modernist formulation. In a number of non-western cultures imitating and appropriating someone’s work is regarded as an act of homage, expected and encouraged in order to inscribe one’s authorship within a tradition; this was also the case in pre-modern Europe and in classical antiquity”  (58).
</blockquote>
  The concepts of homage and appropriation are not mutually exclusive, and any loss of cultural information in the interpretation of a cultural token can be attributed to “paying homage”. It is prudent then to frame cultural appropriation, not as a strictly negative behavior, but as an ongoing relationship between cultures – cultural appropriation must be evaluated without broad generalizations. While new identities and new forms can almost always be attributed to appropriation, it is important to have the cultural appropriation conversation on a case by case basis because its instances might reflect systemic inequality. This is reflected in an argument given by Hesmondhalgh, who specializes in research on music and society, where he describes the struggle between sampling and copyright law as a conflict between “a print culture that is based on ideals of individual autonomy, commodification and capitalism… and a folk culture that emphasizes integration, reclamation and contribution to an intertextual, intergenerational discourse” (54). While this argument seems to support the idea that western modernism skews harmless homage and free speech into a negative interpretation of cultural appropriation, Hesmondhalgh quotes a Steven Feld’s investigation of digital sampling and postulates that “stories of borrowing he (Feld) gathers, including that of the Hancock sample used by Madonna, indicate an escalation of ‘difference, power, control, ownership and authority’” (55). The legality of sampling reflects the institutionalized subdual of minority cultures, and this is reflected in several other instances of cultural appropriation. Treating these exchanges as interactions between cultures of equal societal standing can be detrimental to marginalized cultures, and callous towards their individual experiences.

  Just as valuable aural qualities are lost when a digital audio file is compressed from a lossless format to mp3, there is always a fundamental loss of cultural information when music is adapted from one culture for another, especially when it occurs between two distinct racial groups. The appropriation of hip-hop by white culture causes a disparity that disfavors black American culture while opportunely creating identities for white Americans. In his writing the "Color-Blind Ideology and the Cultural Appropriation of Hip-Hop", Jason Rodriquez cites various sources for possible origins of hip hop. Some accounts say that hip-hop is deeply rooted in African traditions that evolved over time, while others think that hip-hop is the result of a postindustrial political-economy, and yet hip-hop oral history attributes it to a style born from rival gangs butting heads at block parties (649).  Regardless of what combination of these accounts comprise the truth, the core issues still stand when white culture adapts hip-hop. Color-blind white hip-hop artists and listeners, who treat hip-hop as just a type of sound with little regard for the racially encoded content of hip-hop, perpetuate systemic inequalities against blacks by taking the black narrative out of hip-hop. Stated differently by Rodriquez, who is a researcher of culture, race, and ethnography, the new color-blind ideology “acknowledges race while disregarding racial hierarchies by taking racially coded styles and products and reducing these symbols to commodities or experiences that whites and racial minorities can purchase and share” (648-649). The precedence given to the commodification of black experience into a white product is an issue when it occurs in a society where there is still heavy racial tension between these two groups (although the causal relationship between black and white tension and the commodification of hip-hop is unclear). According to interviews held by Rodriquez, white hip-hop fans tended to dissociate hip-hop from its racialized origins to support their own interests, although they acknowledged that race was an issue for other white hip-hop fans other than themselves (662-663). While we do not know Rodriquez’ tone as an interviewer or his questions verbatim, the choice of various interviewees to distinguish themselves from other white hip-hop listeners might suggest a desire to avoid the ethics of white hip-hop in order to justify their stake in it. Iggy Azalea, as described by Tara Morrissey in “The New Real: Iggy Azalea and the Reality Performance", mirrors this color-blind behavior, and has said “that although hip-hop is, in her understanding, a black cultural product, it has become, over time, ‘more than what it was before and more than the main elements of it, you can have places for other people to fit in’” (6).  Iggy constructs a conception of hip-hop that allows her a space to create hip-hop music as a white woman while hand-waving the hip-hop culture’s origin as a single stepping stone in its evolution. Both Rodriquez’s interviewees and Iggy wish to legitimize their stake in hip-hop, and this may be motivated by the fact that “whiteness seems to provide very little substance on which to base an identity” (Rodriquez 646). The adoption of hip-hop reflects a desire to have black culture, but the color-blind treatment of hip-hop shows a lack of regard for black people. The duality of appropriation holds implications for the state of a society, and the direction of the appropriation can be a symptom of wider spread issues of imbalances between different cultures. An assistant professor of Africana studies at Cornell University, Travis L. Gosa, cited the emcee Scarface’s theory that hip-hop is being gentrified, and that “in the musical equivalent of an urban renewal scam, white executives have turned the rap hood into an intellectual ghetto filled with buffoonery, violence and drugs. Once hip-hop is near death, they will bring in white hipster rappers to “revitalize” and “save” the culture” (2). While Gosa takes these claims with a grain of salt, he agrees that music executives should be held under scrutiny because they “ultimately profit from Macklemore being marketed as hip-hop’s Great White Hope” (2). Although there is a separate discussion altogether for the change in hip-hop’s image over the years, Gosa and Scarface’s sentiments support the idea that the inequality represented by the hip-hop scene, and its appropriation, is rooted in American institutions. Exploitative, possibly racist, business practices and color-blind behavior have made the historical black narrative of hip-hop immaterial.

  This is not to say that black culture came into being within a cultural vacuum – the exchange of ideas between cultures has been, and still is, important for circulating new ideas and fostering cultural understanding. In the short-term this process can happen in a way that does not benefit all of the participants in the exchange, and in the long-term the details of the exchange can be lost. Moby’s 1999 electronica album Play, which samples Alan Lomax’s collection of ethnomusicological recordings of southern African-American styles (entitled Sounds of the South), was described by Hesmondhalgh as a “white American singer, whose recordings are distributed by a multinational entertainment corporation, sampling the work of obscure African-American performers who received very little financial compensation for their work” (58). The exchange of ideas was constructed so that Moby could profit, through the bureaucracy of corporate music, off of samples without worrying about reimbursing the original performers who were recorded. Yet, eventually, the estates of the sampled musicians such as Bessie Hall and Vera Jones, were compensated financially while other performers found in Sounds remain uncredited. The question of whether the samples were ethically used is difficult to answer considering the posthumous recompense and the state of anonymity of some of the other Sounds performers. Similar ambiguity resides in the origin of the blues genre: The I-IV-V chord structure commonly attributed to blues, according to pop music critic Sasha Frere-Jones, may not have been a black invention as a 1952 recording showed that “white ‘country’ performers and black ‘blues’ artists had recorded similar material…over similar chord progressions” (2). In this sense, cultural appropriation is a conversation of historical importance because any credit that is not given now may be lost, possibly forever, later on.

  Cultural appropriation, in the short-term, is an asymmetrical, directed flow of information that always breeds some level of misunderstanding despite any good intentions. Even an innocuous homage to a culture can affect the audience’s perception of that group of people; by introducing a foreign culture through select objects, cultural appropriation gives the first impression on how the borrowed culture should be perceived. In reference to Play, Hesmondhalgh argues that “The samples pay tribute to that other culture, even celebrate it, but on terms which ultimately reduce the complexity of the appropriated culture to something crude and simplistic” (63). From an ethical standpoint, then, sampling a cultural style simply for its aesthetic value is irresponsible if the samples are not given within their original contexts. The use of simple African-American rhythm styles can portray their community as primitive, and a cover of a foreign song can devalue its culture of origin. David Novak describes in his writing the American band “Heavenly Ten Stems”, who, through their brief stint of performances, became notorious for wearing eccentric, cobbled outfits featuring cultural garb and for hackneyed performances of foreign songs (59). When interviewed about the social implications of their style one of the band members responded “I guess I can see how we can be taken wrong, but we’re reinterpreting their (Asian) interpretations of Western pop styles. I feel sort of embarrassed that people think we’re racist—but in Japan people dress up like Johnny Cash!” (60). There are a few significant ideas to take away from this response. Cultural appropriation is certainly an ongoing exchange between cultures – Bollywood, although notorious for its exaggerated song and dance sequences in America, is India’s interpretation of American film (Novak 50). However, playing a Bollywood song to a crowd that may not understand its lyrics or origin, while indeed a “reinterpretation”, is an invitation to reduce the Indian culture to what Hesmondhalgh may identify as a “caricatured image” (56). The irreverent fashion in which the Heavenly Ten Stems accessorize foreign culture demeans the significance of these individual cultural objects, despite their enthusiasm for foreign cultures and good intentions. Consider the case described by the Culture Editor of online publication ThinkProgress, Jessica Goldstein, in her article detailing Katy Perry’s heavily criticized 2013 performance of the song “Unconditionally”. Goldstein stated, “Her performance, in the words of Brian Ashcraft, ‘mixed and matched Japanese and Chinese culture as if it were a Pan-Asian buffet’” (1). Despite the cultural inaccuracy and accidental, possibly offensive, fusion of distinct cultures, Perry defended herself thusly:
<blockquote>
  “I guess I’ll just stick to baseball and hot dogs, and that’s it. I know that’s a quote that’s gonna come to fuck me in the ass, but can’t you appreciate a culture? I guess, like, everybody has to stay in their lane? I don’t know.” (1)
</blockquote>
  The distinction between cultural appreciation and ‘staying in your lane’ is the level of understanding you have for the culture you wish to share. Perry’s debacle mirrors the cultural fumbles of the Ten Heavenly Stems and Moby respectively in that Perry’s destruction and melding of Chinese and Japanese culture for American audiences was born of a simple desire to relate her music with another culture. A desire for cultural flair and tribute came at the price of disseminating misinformation; culture, if appropriated carelessly, can portray other cultures in a new, untrue, light.

  Despite all of this, cultural appropriation has also been an empowering form of expression for marginalized social groups. For demographics that are the outgroups of their society, traditional means of expression may be unavailable or inaccessible to them. In order to feel heard they would then have to rely on expressions outside of their culture, and cultural appropriation allows these outgroups to create markers for themselves to identify with. Alessandra Lopez Y. Royo describes such a case, where the gamelan, an Indonesian instrument ensemble found commonly in Java and Bali, became a symbol for homosexuality, despite it not having any such meaning in its regions of origin: “the gamelan was appropriated, on the West Coast, as a gay marker, undoubtedly because one of its most prominent devotees, the composer Lou Harrison, was also a known gay activist who explicitly identified with the ‘other’ through his musical choices” (58). She later goes on to posit that “it is an appropriation which affords a decentering and destabilizing of heterosexuality and its normativity. Through a staging of sexuality, it acts as a corrective to the perception of a projected neutrality of music and dance, normally upheld as a basis for the exercise of power” (59). The adoption of a foreign musical sound, and its abnormal application in musical compositions, became the calling card for gays and allowed them to fight against the societal norms being imposed on them without a need to know the cultural origins of the gamelan. Similarly, genres of music too can become a vital form of expression for outgroups. Swedish rap verses cited by Kalle Berggren in "Hip Hop Feminism In Sweden: Intersectionality, Feminist Critique And Female Masculinity", such as “never ran out of cash after half the month, never worked like hell and still forced to borrow, never rejected by social services and been evicted, left without anything, treated like dirt, its real to many” (237), illustrate the experiences that marginalized single mothers have adapted into hip-hop. Almost as an antithesis to the white hip-hop fans interviewed by Rodriquez and Iggy Azalea, white Swedish women have appropriated an African American medium, but have also preserved some core values of hip-hop by using it as a means of social critique and personal narrative of struggle.

  The nuances of the effects of cultural appropriation in music on identity is difficult, perhaps impossible, to discuss in full scope. There is no binary answer to the ethicality of cultural appropriation; cultural appropriation can enable people to come together and speak but it can splinter the identities of foreign cultures; it can be a well-meaning tribute to a culture but it will always be somewhat disingenuous and misleading; it can modify how we perceive music and alter our perception of its history and identity; it can maintain or establish a climate of oppression upon a minority culture; it can allow one to assume a new identity; it can bring foreign culture into circulation in domestic media; it can create new culture whose comprising elements are unrecognizable; it can underscore and reflect systemic issues in society, and so it must be evaluated independently as it happens. In all the cases where cultural appropriation allows the creation of identity and culture, I cannot help but feel that the work would not be undone if some research is done in hindsight; there is no harm in learning more, and there is no shame in admitting to mistakes. To foster innovation and understanding in both music and cultural exchanges, an open mind is invaluable for approaching cultural appropriation in its duality.
