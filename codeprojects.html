			<span>Hey there, are you interested in my code?</span>
			<p>
				These projects were developed by a creator (me), for creatives (you);
				tools for artists building websites from scratch; weirdly specific widgets for live streamers - 
				some love for kindred creators. Craters? Does the word 'creative' sound weird to you as well?
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of these repos started as personal solutions, that I then modularized and polished up for public use.
				Any problem that I run into is probably not unique to my own work - so hopefully my effort is useful to other people.

			<p class="card-details"> 
				A plug-and-play module that turns any webpage's images into a functional modal gallery via a single HTML class. 
				It is self-contained and written with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no additional libraries or frameworks.

			<p class="card-details">
				A chrome extension that allows streamers to have the title & artist for their music displayed as text in OBS. 
				The extension writes the title of a Youtube/Souncloud/etc tab to a plain .txt file, which OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) can then read as a text source.
