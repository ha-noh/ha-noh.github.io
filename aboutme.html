		<br>At the core, basically I'm just someone who likes to make stuff; I like putting together websites, tinkering with
		photoshop, writing and producing music, painting, theorycrafting pc builds on pcpartpicker... you know, making stuff!
		<br><br>Put visually, if I was the triforce, the three little triangles would probably be drawing, music, and programming. 
		Little gold pieces spinning, spinning, spinning... ad nauseam - waiting to be harnessed. <br><br>Haunting.
		<br><br>I have yet to unify these three pursuits proper - when I do, I'm sure something <em>really</em> neat will happen (maybe it will grant me a wish, like the real thing). This site exists so I can prove I chased these things; proof to myself and to you. 
		<br><br>If you would like to contact me - because you need me to make something for you, because you want to say hello, or because you absolutely must notify me of a Nigerian Astronaut who needs my capital, two out of three times I would love to hear from you!
