A website to catalog my various personal projects, including: artwork, software, and music.

## TODO
1) ~~Have home page panels redirect to the appropriate gallery category~~ 
2) ~~Add dark borders to panels & try out background images~~
3) ~~Pass nightmode state between pages~~
4) ~~Localize navbar html & css to one file~~
5) ~~Maybe move the gallery hamburger icon to somewhere closer to the rest of the content~~
6) ~~Move down taborder of non-menu items when side navigation bar is open~~
7) ~~Add Aria labels to all buttons?~~
8) ~~Have navbar icons look more organized and not floating in space~~
9) ~~Change how image height is determined in the gallery~~
10) Create a landing page or page overlay for every panel - right now some panels just link to external pages without any context
11) ~~Remove jquery calls and fontawesome icons from navbar & gallery~~
12) ~~Move image gallery modal files to separate directory, watch for changes to update respective github repository~~
13) Add some kind of user interactable element - simplest suggestion would be a guestbook
14) ~~Add "return to top of page" to gallery header~~
15) ~~Add sidebar to all pages or a "return to top" link instead~~
16) ~~Add high resolution (1440p, 4K) media queries for all pages since they are currently styled for 1080p screens~~
17) ~~Animation for aboutme page and details~~
18) ~~Shrink header footprint; left-justified? sticky?~~
19) ~~Add header navigation / mobile burger icon to all pages for ease of use~~
20) Change gallery modal buttons to be a single row of buttons so its position is more predictable across all viewports.
21) ~~Add a demo link to a live demo page for code projects.~~
22) Minify js

## Bugs
1) Home page link in header doesn't align properly with text when stickied

## Browser Compatibility
- Keyboard navigation in Firefox is weird; it allows you to focus the body DOM element if you tab to the bottom of any given page. Issue is not present in Chrome.
