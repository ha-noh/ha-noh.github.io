Redesigned personal website that uses flexbox and other css magic to visually present my work

## Testing 
1) run `python -m http.server 8000` in terminal from site's root directory
2) open `localhost:8000` in browser

## TODO
1) Create a landing page or page overlay for every panel -  right now some panels just link to external pages without any context
2) Add dark borders to panels & try out background images
3) Pass nightmode state between pages
4) localize navbar html & css to one file
