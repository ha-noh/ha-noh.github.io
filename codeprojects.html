			<span>Hey there, you found my not-so-secret code stash.</span>
			<p>
				I will posit that these projects were developed by a creative (me), for creatives (possibly you);
				for artists building their own websites from scratch; for live streamers who need that very specific widget - those people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of these repos started as solutions for my own interests, that were then modularized and polished up a bit for the public.
				My thought is that any problem I run into is not unique to my own workflow - hopefully my effort is useful to others as well.

			<p class="card-details"> A plug-and-play module that turns any webpage's images into a functional modal gallery via a single HTML class. It is self-contained and written with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no additional libraries or frameworks. </p>

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/ha-noh/NowPlaying-Title-Export-for-chrome" target="_blank">"now playing" title export</a></h2>
			
			<p class="card-details"> A chrome extension that allows streamers to have the title & artist for their music displayed as text in OBS. The extension writes the title of a Youtube/Souncloud/etc tab to a plain .txt file, which OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) can then read as a text source. </p>
