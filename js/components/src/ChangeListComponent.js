			'The website now remembers if you toggled nightmode (in your current session), and renders the page accordingly!'
	},
	{
		date: '12/17/19',
		comment: 
			'You can now read the home page headings even if you are navigating with a keyboard - the panels now properly display their headings when focused.'
	},	
	{
		date: '6/2/20',
		comment: 
			`Keyboard navigation in the gallery is now fully implemented; 
			you can now use arrow keys to navigate through gallery images and use the enter key to click on them. Neat.`
	},
	{
		date: '6/18/20',
		comment: 
			`Gallery images can now be previewed in full by focusing or hovering them. 
			The modal has been updated to look more cohesive.`
	},
	{
		date: '7/3/20',
		comment: 
			`The gallery modal buttons can now be hidden for an unobstructed view of the image.
			The buttons are also more visible now.`
	},
	{
		date: '8/11/20',
		comment: 
			`The gallery sidebar is more tactful now and automatically gets out of the user's way.
			The gallery has also received a much needed visual overhaul (uniform, square thumbnails!).`
	},
	{
		date: '10/5/20',
		comment: 
			`There is now a descriptive landing page for code projects instead of a direct link to my github.

	},
	{
		date: '10/16/20', 
		comment:
			`It's time to say goodbye to the lightmode toggle ðŸ˜¢. The toggle feature was always a compromise, 
			and having two color modes for every page brought twice the issues. While it was fun to work on, unfortunately it was more prohibitive than useful.`
	},
	{
		date: '12/5/20',
		comment: 
			`You can now reach any of the site's pages, from any page, with one click (two for mobile).
			The new navbar makes the site easier to navigate.`
