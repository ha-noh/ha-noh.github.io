				Hello, I'm Andrew. You can find my various work in web design, illustration, music, and programming on this site. There's not much else to say at the moment, so I'll list some of the improvements I've made to this site:
			</summary>
			<br>
			<details>
				<p>
					<b>9/10/19</b>
					- The website now remembers if you toggled nightmode (in your current session), and renders the page accordingly!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>12/17/19</b>
					- You can now read the home page headings even if you are navigating with a keyboard - the panels now properly display their headings when focused.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>6/2/20</b>
					- Keyboard navigation in the gallery is now fully implemented; you can now use arrow keys to navigate through gallery images and use the enter key to click on them. Neat.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>6/18/20</b>
					- Gallery images can now be previewed in full by focusing or hovering them. 
					The modal has been updated to look more cohesive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>7/3/20</b>
					- The gallery modal buttons can now be hidden for an unobstructed view of the image.
					The buttons are also more visible now.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>8/11/20</b>
					- The gallery sidebar is more tactful now and automatically gets out of the user's way.
					The gallery has also received a much needed visual overhaul (uniform, square thumbnails!).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>10/5/20</b>
					- There is now a descriptive landing page for the code projects section instead of a direct link to my github.
					The gallery categories are now mutually exclusive and aren't visible to each other through the modal.
				</p>
