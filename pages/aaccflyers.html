    <p>* I'm more comfortable with traditional drawing than digital so I am v happy with how the lineart turned out. </br>
       * The imagery is a bit on the nose but I think clarity is nice to have in advertising. </br>
       * If I were to change this now I would use a different font for the url and phone # for readability. </br> </br>
       * Fun Fact: The image is a square because of cropping inconsistencies interns had when setting this as their profile photo. </br>

      * (for the year of the monkey), but now I think the white space would've looked less visually noisy. </br>

    <p> * While I like the concept of having the image be a first person view from within the cockpit of a space craft, </br>
      * in retrospect I think the final image doesn't really convey that idea clearly enough. I was also obsessed with making </br>
      * all the assets pixel art, and when the only reason for doing something is "because I wanted to" I think it shows. </br>
      * At least this adorable planet was created in that process:
